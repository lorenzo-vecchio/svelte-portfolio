Implements every component from scratch: forward and backward passes, ReLU and Softmax activations, cross-entropy loss, He weight initialisation, and mini-batch SGD. Trained on 60,000 MNIST images, it reaches 97.4% accuracy on the 10,000-image test set. The source code is intentionally written as a learning artifact — every concept (backprop, the chain rule, overfitting, normalisation) is explained in plain English directly in comments, making the codebase a readable reference for programmers new to machine learning.",
